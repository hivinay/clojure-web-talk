# Web stuff with Clojure!
### A talk by Vinay Hiremath (2015-07-23)
---

# Agenda

### 1. Basics of Clojure
### 2. Basics of a backend
### 3. Making a very simple app

---

# What is Clojure? (besides the best language ever!)
* A dialect of the Lisp language

* Based on the Java Virtual Machine

* Strong emphasis on functional programming

---

# What does that mean for me?
* Relatively small language so it's easy to learn

* Quite fast because it compiles to Java bytecode and is not interpreted

* The abstractions make handling sequences of data extremely easy

* Easy to reason about large projects because state is effectively nonexistent

---

# Great, where do I sign up?
* Set up Leiningen (http://leiningen.org/)
  * Or if you're on Windows, try this installer: http://leiningen-win-installer.djpowell.net/

* Leiningen is a comprehensive build tool for managing your Clojure projects

* Today, we'll stick to deploying and testing out an app on Heroku (an online platform to run apps)

---

# Some basics
* Variables are basically always immutable in Clojure
  * `(def my-name "Vinay")`
  * Creates a global constant variable (string) called `name` with the value `"Vinay"`

* Clojure embodies the *code is data* philosophy, so function implementations are assigned to function names
  * `(def my-function (fn [x] (+ 5 x)))`
  * Creates a function called `my-function` that returns the sum of `5` and a parameter `x`

---

# Some more
* Let's simplify that by sticking to the `defn` macro
  * `(defn my-function [x] (+ 5 x))`

* As you can see, `defn` is followed by:
  * The function name
  * The function parameters in `[ ]`
  * The function implementation

* You can call the function like so:
  * `(my-function 4) ;; Result is 9 in this case`

---

# S-expressions
![S-expression tree](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e3/Corrected_S-expression_tree_2.png/589px-Corrected_S-expression_tree_2.png)
* This is a diagram for `(* 2 (+ 3 4))`, which evalutes to `(3 + 4) * 2 = 14`

* Note that the function is still followed by its arguments to keep things consistent and easy to reason about!
  * No order of operations! Eg. `(- (+ 1 (/ (* 2 3) 4)) 5)`

---

# What is a backend?
* It's basically a process on a server hidden from view that handles data

* It can both get and send data to a client (eg. a web page or mobile app)

* This allows for everything to stay in sync because the clients only need to handle the interface

* The backend often includes a database, which is a place to collect and easily look through large amounts of data

---

# What are we making?
* We will be making the backend for a simple contact list that allows for:
  * Adding contacts (by name and email) to the database
  * Listing out contacts currently in the database

* The main tool we will be using is `Compojure`, a routing library for Clojure that uses Ring

* We will also be using a `PostgreSQL` database to hold data on each contact

---

# Let's begin!
* You should have Leiningen installed, and can verify this by typing `lein -v` into a shell (Terminal or Command Prompt)
  * If you do not, check out the slides later as they are posted online!

* You should also have today's code downloaded and saved
  * If not, you can find them here: github.com/hivinay/contacts-backend-clj

* Let's go over all of the code before we test it out

---

# The `db.clj` file
* You can find this file inside the project under `src/contacts-backend-clj/db.clj`

* This file defines functions that are used to access the database

* In this case, we only need functions for adding a contact and getting a list of every contact

```
(defn add-contact ;; Function name
  [item] ;; Function parameter
  (db/insert! postgres-db db-name ;; Function that inserts into the database
              {:name (:name item)
               :email (:email item)}))

(defn get-contacts
  []
  (db/query postgres-db ["SELECT * FROM contacts"]))

```
---

# The routes in `core.clj`
* You can find this file in the same folder as the `db.clj`

* This file defines the main functions that are used to handle requests

* We need to implement each route so that a user can add a contact and view all contacts, including the helper files needed for these functions

* Defining empty routes that we will fill in later

```
(defroutes contacts-app
  (GET "/contacts" []
       (get-a-list-of-all-contacts)
  (POST "/contacts" request
        (add-a-contact))
```

---
# The routes in `core.clj`

```
(defroutes contacts-app
  (GET "/contacts" []
       {:status 200
        :body (db/get-items)}
  (POST "/contacts" request
        (db/add-item (:body request))))
```
* The `POST` route can also be written as follows:
```
  (POST "/contacts" request
        (-> request
            :body
            db/add-item)))
```
---
# The main functions
```
(defn handler
  []
  (-> contacts-app
      access-headers
      (wrap-json-body {:keywords? true})
      wrap-json-response))

(defn -main
  []
  (do (db/create-table)
      (println "Running...")
      (run-server (handler) {:port (read-string (System/getenv "PORT"))})))
```

* The `handler` function can also be written as this mess:
```
(defn handler
  []
  (wrap-json-response (wrap-json-body (access-headers contacts-app))
                        {:keywords? true}))
 ```

---
# Who's JSON?
```
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "A green door",
    "price": 12.50,
    "tags": ["home", "green"]
}
```

---

# Deploy!
* Go to http://github.com/hivinay/contacts-backend-clj
  * Click the purple button and follow the instructions on Heroku

  * Note the address of your app (you can choose your own)

* Once it's deployed, you can:
  * Go to `hivinay.com/contacts-backend-clj` and change the app name in the URL to your Heroku app (or just use mine!)

  * Use `curl` to test it out with (replacing your app path):
      * View: `curl http://contacts-clj.herokuapp.com/contacts`

      * Add: `curl -d '{"name":"vinay", "email":"my@email.com"}' contacts-clj.herokuapp.com/contacts`
